# Color-Identifier
This is a Chrome Extension build with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON. This extension will help you to get the hexadecimal code of the color on which you have click when this extension is active on your desktop. And the same hexadecimal code will be copied to your clipboard for future use if needed.
